# ChocoUtil
 A personal library of Unity utilities.

This library has three goals:
1. To serve as a public repository that can represent my programming capabilities.
2. To serve as a minimal-dependency library that can be plugged to any Unity project.
    * Which means only built-in packages.
3. To improve code reuse across my personal projects.
